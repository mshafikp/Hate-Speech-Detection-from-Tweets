# Hate-Speech-Detection-from-Tweets

## OBJECTIVE: Text classification and develop skills in data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

The first method involved using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is a widely used algorithm for text classification tasks. The tweets were initially tokenized with NLTK, and then stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization were applied. Stopword reduction is deleting frequent terms like "the," "a," and "is" that have little meaning in the text. Stemming is the process of reducing words to their simplest form, such as "running" to "run." The text data was then transformed using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) vectorizer, which is a popular technique for converting text into numerical features that can be used in machine learning algorithms. The second method involved using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model, which is a type of neural network that can capture the context and dependencies between words in a sentence. The data was preprocessed using NLTK and tokenized using the TensorFlow tokenizer. The tokenized data was then passed through the BiLSTM model, which learned to classify the text data into the relevant categories. The third method also used a BiLSTM model, but instead of using the TensorFlow tokenizer, the text data was preprocessed using NLTK and transformed using the TFIDF vectorizer. This allowed for a different approach to encoding the text data as numerical features, which I believed could potentially improve the classification performance of the model
